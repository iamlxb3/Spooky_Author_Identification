Kaggle competition - Spooky_Author_Identification

I've tried many sequence models like rnn and lstm, but none of them worked.

This best model is an MLP with bi-gram tf-idf features. The best hyper-parameter is found by random search.
It seems tri-gram is better, but I haven't got time to try it though.
